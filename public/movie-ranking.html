            <h3>Avatar - Both Movies</h3>
            <p>Fantastic story, great animation and although for some people it might have been a long movie, for me I was hooked throughout</p>
        <br>
            <h3>Aliens</h3>
            <p>Cult classic and even the newer ones are awesome. I hope Ridley Scott makes another one</p>
        <br>
            <h3>I am Legend</h3>
            <p>Scary at night for the character. But during the day he has that solitary life with no people around. I want that.</p>
